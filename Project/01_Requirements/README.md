## Water Supply Control
- water tank overflow is a common problem which leads to the wastage of water. A circuit which will detect the water level and will glow a led upon getting the water tank full or a preset level. Water level indicator is a modern way of measuring the water level using latest technologies like sensors,arduino.The main aim of the project is to calculate the water level at any instant of time. We use arduino and ultrasonic sensor to make it possible. This may be useful to conserve water and helps us.

#### Arduino
- Arduino UNO is a low-cost, flexible, and easy-to-use programmable open-source microcontroller board that can be integrated into a variety of electronic projects. This board can be interfaced with other Arduino boards ,and can control relays, LEDs, servos, and motors as an output.
#### Servo Motor
- The function of the servo motor is to convert the control signal of the controller into the rotational angular displacement or angular velocity of the motor output shaft. Servo motor is used to drive the joints.
#### Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR01)
- To determine the distance to the water, it transmits a sound pulse that reflects from the surface of the water and measures the time it takes for the echo to return. To automatically control open and close the water gate, we use Ultrasonic sensors as input values
#### Potentiometer
- The mechanical system of sensor is destined to convert linearly the value of potentiometer resistance to the water level variation. The signal conditioning consists of analog and digital system especially microcontroller circuit.
#### Voltmeter
- Voltmeters can also be used to measure DC voltage as well as sinusoidal AC voltages but the introduction of a voltmeter as a measuring instrument into a circuit can interfere with its steady state conditions.
