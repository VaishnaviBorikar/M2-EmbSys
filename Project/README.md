## Water Supply Control

- water tank overflow is a common problem which leads to the wastage of water. A circuit which will detect the water level and will glow a led upon getting the water tank full or a preset level. Water level indicator is a modern way of measuring the water level using latest technologies like sensors,arduino.The main aim of the project is to calculate the water level at any instant of time. We use arduino and ultrasonic sensor to make it possible. This may be useful to conserve water and helps us.
